# Introduction
This is the preprocessed version of the dataset that means various data augmentation techniques, as mentioned in the papers [paper1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2631-8695/ad3dae/meta) , [paper2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10585829),are already implemented. 
These papers invetigate various machine learning, deep learning and explainable Ai aproaches to detect faults in motors using sounds. 
To utilize this data, make sure the papers are cited.
